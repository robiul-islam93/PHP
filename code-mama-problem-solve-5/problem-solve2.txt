Problem Statement
Suppose, you work in a toy car workshop, and your job is to build toy cars from a collection of parts. Each toy car needs 4 wheels, 1 car body, and 2 figures of people to be placed inside. Write a program which will calculate how many complete toy cars can be made, given the total number of wheels, car bodies and figures available.

Input
The input consists of three integers: number of wheels, car bodies, figures.

Output
The output will print the number of cars.

Constraints
0 ≤ |S| ≤ 10000
Example:
Enter numbers

Input:
43 15 87
Output:
10


Answer:


<?php
    # Write your PHP code from here
    fscanf(STDIN, "%d %d %d", $wheels, $car_body, $figure);


    $max_car_from_wheels = floor($wheels / 4);
    $max_car_from_car_body = floor($car_body / 1);
    $max_car_from_figure = floor($figure / 2);

  
    $max_cars = min($max_car_from_wheels, $max_car_from_car_body, $max_car_from_figure);


    print $max_cars;
?>
